# Marquesina

This VHDL code implements a marquee effect using an FPGA. The marquee effect involves displaying characters in a sequential manner, creating a scrolling effect similar to a marquee.

## Description

The VHDL entity `marquesina` defines the input and output ports required for the marquee operation. Inputs include signals for sensor input, clock signal, and additional clock signal (`clks`). Outputs include signals for controlling LEDs, audio output, multiplexed display, and other control signals.

The architecture `Behavioral` contains the implementation of the marquee functionality. It utilizes various internal signals and processes to manage the display of characters, control LED behavior, and generate audio output.

The marquee operation involves dividing the overall functionality into smaller processes. These processes handle tasks such as generating clock signals of different frequencies, updating the display sequence, and controlling LED behavior based on input signals.

## Usage

To use this VHDL code, you need an FPGA development board along with suitable development tools. The code can be synthesized and implemented on the FPGA using tools provided by FPGA vendors such as Xilinx or Intel.

Make sure to connect input signals such as sensor input and clock signals appropriately based on your hardware setup. The output signals can be connected to LEDs, audio output devices, and multiplexed displays as required.
